### Description
This is the **test assignment** for the CS 1656 -- Introduction to Data Science (CS 2056) class, for the Spring 2021 semester.

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the project submission process.

### What to do - task.py
Your task is to trivially modify the `hello_world(self, val)` function to set the `val`variable to `"Hello World!"`, and then return `val`.

### How to submit your assignment
We are going to use Gradescope to submit and grade your assignments. 

To submit your assignment:
* login to Canvas for this class <https://cs1656.org>  
* click on Gradescope from the menu on the left  
* select "Assignment #0" from the list of active assignments in Gradescope
* follow the instructions to submit your assignment and have it automatically graded.

### What to submit
For this test assignment you only need to submit `task.py` to "Assignment #0" and see if you get all 100 points. In case of an error or wrong result, you can modify the file and resubmit it as many times as you want until the deadline of **Monday, Feb 1, 11:59 pm**.

### Late submissions
For full points, we will consider the version submitted to Gradescope 
* the day of the deadline **Monday, Feb 1, 11:59 pm**  
* 24 hours later (for submissions that are one day late / -5 points), and  
* 48 hours after the first deadline (for submissions that are two days late / -15 points).

Our assumption is that everybody will submit on the first deadline. If you want us to consider a late submission, you need to email us at `cs1656-staff@cs.pitt.edu`

### Important notes about grading
It is absolutely imperative that your python program:  
* runs without any syntax or other errors (using Python 3)  
* strictly adheres to the format specifications for input and output, as explained above.     
Failure in any of the above will result in **severe** point loss. 

### About your github account
Since we will utilize the github classroom feature to distribute the assignments it is very important that your github account can do **private** repositories. If this is not already enabled, you can do it by visiting <https://education.github.com/>
